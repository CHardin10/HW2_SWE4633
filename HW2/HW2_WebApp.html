        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Robert Hardin, and I am a senior at Kennesaw State University. I am from a small town called
            Chickamauga, GA, which is in north Georgia, just south of Chattanooga, TN. I received my Associates
            degree in Integrated Technology at Dalton State College in 2019, before becoming a student at KSU that very 
            year. My hobbies include playing video games, watching TV and movies, and reading. I also spend a lot of
            time with my family and girlfriend Bryana.
